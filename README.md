# Windows 12 Web Edition

> **🎉🎉 Happy 1st Anniversary to Windows 12 Web Edition! `o(^o^)o`**  
> **Thank you all for your incredible support!**

Season follows season; a full year has passed.
With winds behind us, waves rise high; in the deep night, the first starlight appears.
Across the world, true companionship is rare, yet you stayed through spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
With you beside us, even frozen rivers and snowy mountains are nothing to fear — youth should never be underestimated.
May I be the stars, and you the moon — shining together night after night.

Thank you all for a year of encouragement, support, criticism, and suggestions.
With everyone’s effort, the future of Windows 12 will only shine brighter!

Nine years of study behind the cold window,
A single exam to determine one’s fate.
When the mountains are crossed and the clouds disperse,
A thousand rays of dawn will appear.
Once I reach the golden list of honor,
We shall meet again and talk about this past year.
Until then — farewell, my friends, see you next year!

## Introduction

Inspired by a PowerPoint-based “Windows 12 Concept”, we decided to create a **fully interactive Windows 12 Web Edition**, similar to the well-known  
[Windows 11 Web](https://win11.blueedge.me/).

Expect:

- Beautiful modern UI  
- Smooth animations  
- Advanced desktop-like features  
- Built-in apps and personalization options  

> Mobile experience is not fully optimized yet.  
> Please switch to “Desktop Mode” on your browser. `>v-)o`
